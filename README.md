# RiBus

<b>iOS developer:</b> Abou Aldan Jasmin<br>
<b>Android developer:</b> Loncar Mario<br>
<b>Project was developed as part of:</b> Undergraduate final thesis <i>Application development for iOS</i> (Rijeka, 2015) and MIPRO International ICT Convention (Opatija, May 25, 2015, Digital Economy and Government/Local Government/Public Services) with thesis <i>Citybus Mobile Application</i><br>
<b>Description:</b> RiBus is beautifully designed app that gives you all info about local bus lines in Rijeka.
 
It provides timetable for city bus lines, locations of bus stations and estimated departing time of the next bus for the selected line. It also helps you not to wander looking for bus stop by providing shortest route from your location to certain bus stop.
 
Idea for this app came out of sheer need. Students, tourists and citizens often get confused by bus lines or get tired of running to catch their bus. RiBus is here to make your life easier.

Application uses, for its calculation, official timetables in which a bus should be on station. Currently, it does not show if the bus came earlier on a station or is it late.
